The "[[Rumbling]]" refers to the day the #Cultist group hidden in [[Madison County High School]] started the procedure to summon a Hydra. The event caused the shutting down of MCHS and the deaths of multiple students and faculty, including [[Oliver]], [[Pax]], [[Mrs. Lee]], [[Principal P'Fortis]], and 6 more students. The events were incited by the [[Librarian]], who seems to play an important role in the Cult's leadership and planning. This event occurred during [[Session 1]].
