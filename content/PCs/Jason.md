### Personality

Jason’s emotions are easily influenced by others. He is very loyal to his friends and looks up to them (especially the wrestling team) as role models. If someone he is close to gets passionate/heated over something that happens, He will usually start to feel the same way regardless of what he felt before. While he might have good intentions, his execution is often poor. He has always struggled with his emotions but tries to keep them in check through different outlets such as Fishing and Minecraft. When he does focus on self-care and restraint, he is much more chill and relaxed. Jason is often described by others as reserved and impressionable.

### Relationships

###### [[Heather]]
Grew up as neighborhood friends and dated in middle school, drifted apart in high school, Their friendship ended after Junior year when Jason confronted her in the mall about being a bad person/friend. Relationship now strained, and Jason grows more resentful as he hears more of what Heather does to others.

###### [[Pax]]
Best friends since middle school. Jason and Paxton cannot be separated as they are always hanging out in practice and afterschool. Paxton always shares exaggerated gossip going on in the school to Jason. 

###### [[Sabrina]]
Ex-girlfriend. Had a crush on her since Freshman year, but only started dating her mid-Sophomore year. Went on double dates with Heather and Pax after school and during prom. Their relationship was overall positive, but they did get into fights towards the end due to Jason’s emotions acting up. Jason believed that they would try to go long distance after high school. Their breakup was tough, and Jason still hasn’t gotten over her.

###### [[Alice]]
Gym buddies with Jason senior year. Jason always sees her at the gym and recognizes her from school, but didn’t know her name for the longest time. Started referring to her as “Hot Streaks” before realizing she was gay, so now he just calls her “Streaks”. Jason shares his interests with Alice, and Alice vents about Heather while they work out.

###### [[Mr. Sterling]]

###### [[Principal P'Fortis]]
Neutral. Jason sees the Principal in the main office when Jason waits for his Dad to be done with work before being taken home. The Principal is aware of Jason’s previous demeanors against other students from elementary to middle school, but his record has been clean since. However, Jason has recently been called to the office to testify for allegations against the Wrestling team and Paxton.

Club(s): Wrestling, Martial Arts Instructor (TBD: maybe taekwondo or karate?)
Hobbies: Minecraft, fishing, skating.

Childhood:
Transferred to Madison County (where his dad works in the district) after an incident at his elementary school in which Jason threw a chair at a student. A psychiatrist recommended that Jason have better outlets to express himself, so Mr. Sterling began to take Jason fishing at the beach/ocean. Jason ended up loving it and started to fish by himself at a creek near their house. Beginning of middle school he befriended his next-door neighbor, Heather, and took her to fish or play Minecraft with him. Heather would force Jason to play Barbie's and join the school choir. The two dated for one month in 7th grade, however, remained close friends after their breakup. During middle school, Jason participated in an after-school/summer martial arts program where he befriended Paxton. Otherwise, Jason was pretty out casted cause he was a dork who wore Minecraft t-shirts.

Best subject: Biology
Worst subject: English

Highschool:

Freshman year: While Jason and Heather stayed friends at the start of high school, Paxton started to be a lot closer to Jason than Heather. Jason began to look up to Paxton as a sort of older brother figure, doing whatever Pax wanted to do. When Pax suggested quitting the martial arts program to join a “manly-er” sport to get more popular, Jason was hesitant. It was only when he tried asking out Sabrina (and got horribly rejected) that he finally joined the wrestling team. 

Sophomore-Junior year: Glow-up and confidence era. Jason caught Sabrina during a cheer practice in front of the wrestling team. Sabrina started to crush on Jason and got his number from Pax. Jason thought the text was a prank from the wrestling team since they knew Jason still had a crush on Sabrina. They went on their first date after Sabrina confronted him about leaving her on read the next day. They started dating mid-sophomore year until the summer after Junior year. Their relationship ended abruptly, and Jason still isn’t sure what he did wrong or why Sabrina broke up with him. Jason also ends his relationship with Heather after he confronts her at the mall for ghosting him, which escalates into him getting upset at Heather for cheating on Pax. Jason begins to work as an instructor at the martial arts program this summer.

Senior year-now: Jason’s main circle is the wrestling team. The team is very intense and gets Jason involved in a lot of drama within the school. At this point Jason is the most emotional he has been in years and stops fishing and playing Minecraft completely. The only person he somewhat talks to outside of the team is his gym buddy, Alice, who he calls “Streaks”. Jason ends up getting into a verbal, then physical fight with Heather during passing period when he confronts Heather about getting Pax kicked off the Wrestling team and Captain position. This fight gets him into detention.

Post-Highschool Goals::
Jason plans to attend a two-year community college on an Athletic scholarship to study either Marine Biology or Ecology. He has considered joining the Navy but is unsure if Sabrina would avoid the topic.
