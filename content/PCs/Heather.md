### Basic Info

- Full Name: Heather Madden
- Human Barbarian
- Thespian originally from [[Madison County High School]]
- Ex childhood friend of [[Jason]]
- Ex friend of [[Sabrina]]

### Personality

Generously referred to as a "bitch" by those who don't know her and also those who do, Heather is a mean girl in every sense of the phrase. Bullying others while striving to be the center of attention, Heather was possibly the most hated student at [[Madison County High School]]. Unsurprisingly, she puts on these airs because she is extremely emotionally fragile, probably also the reason she started doing theatre.

### Relationships

##### [[Jason]]
Exes, childhood friends. The two of them dated in middle school and are not currently on good terms after she ruined Pax's future. Very long and detailed history to say the least. Currently on extremely bad terms as they just got into a physical altercation and are in detention together.

##### [[Pax]]
Enemies, exes. Heather was a terrible girlfriend while they were dating and obviously didn't care about him, so he kissed another girl to see if she would even react. When she didn't care, he broke things off with her and started rumors about her cheating on him and being an overall bitch. As revenge, Heather got his sports scholarship taken away by showing texts that he bought weed (which he did for her). 

##### [[Sabrina]]
Poor, the two of them were friends while Sabrina was dating Jason but after Sabrina confronted her on being a bad girlfriend to [[Pax]], Heather blew up on her and they have not been on speaking terms for a while.
