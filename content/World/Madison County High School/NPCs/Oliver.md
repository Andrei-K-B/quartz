#Cultist #MCHS 

### Basic Info

- Full Name: Oliver P'Fortis
- [[Sabrina]]'s boyfriend
- Student Council President at [[Madison County High School]]
- Son of the [[Principal P'Fortis]]

### Personality

Oliver is exactly what you think of when you think of Student Council President. He is very prim and proper and has an air about him that makes you feel lesser just by standing near him. He is very stringent in the way he talks with others, almost like his words are a binding contract. Although nepotism got him his position, he is very hard working and is of the mind that there is no obstacle he cannot overcome if he puts his mind to it, and he is mostly correct.

### Relationships

##### [[Sabrina]]
Romantically involved, Oliver and Sabrina have been dating for 7 months. He is strictly against PDA due to school guidelines (that he made) and is very possessive of her much to her chagrin

### Plot

Oliver is the faux-head of the cultists hiding in the school. Resenting his lack of real power, he made a deal with the [[Librarian]] to start the cult in order to gain power. His sacrificial target is [[Sabrina]], who he has been growing increasingly frustrated with after she has been resisting his controlling nature more and more.
