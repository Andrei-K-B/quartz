#MCHS 

### Basic Info

- Full Name: Alice Incense, AKA Streaks
	- Streaks comes from when [[Jason]] first started becoming gym buddies with her. As she has dyed blue streak in her hair, that is what she was called when he didn't know her name.
- [[Jason]]'s gym buddy
- [[Heather]]'s (suppressed) crush and bullying target
- Honorary Head of Theatre tech department at [[Madison County High School]]
	- Honrary becuase there isn't really a head, she is just there most of the time and has the most experience out of everyone else there. 

### Personality

Alice is a emo who doesn't let much get to her. She has a lot of self confidence in herself, especially after bulking up at the gym, so comments from those such as [[Heather]] don't really effect her. Pretty quiet and stoic, but a reliable friend who won't hesitate to take initiative if the situation calls for it.

### Relationships

##### [[Heather]]
Indifferent. Heather tries to bully her frequently, and they spend a lot of time together both being in Theatre. However, Alice doesn't really care about Heather and doesn't really notice that she is being bullied by her. Heather is subconsciously targeting Alice because she is a suppressed lesbian with feelings for her, but she is not aware of this.

##### [[Jason]]
Gym buddies, they don't know much about each other but they get along well.  

##### [[Sabrina]]
Antagonistic, Alice was the one who reported Sabrina for trying to steal the school's primary printer because she was trying to print flyers for the upcoming play. 

### Plot

Alice is being held hostage by [[Miley]] backstage of the auditorium. She has the info that the players need that the door leading to the school underbelly is across the hallway from the library.
