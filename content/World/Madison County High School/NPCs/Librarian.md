#Cultist #MCHS

### Basic Info

- Full Name: Unknown
- Librarian at [[Madison County High School]]

### Personality

A mostly mysterious man, little is known about the Librarian, even by the nerdiest students who spend much time in the school's library. He rarely talks if not spoken to, and frequently speaks in monotone.

### Relationships

##### [[Principal P'Fortis]]
It is commonly speculated that the Librarian is the "Shadow Ruler" of [[Madison County High School]], since the Principal is so incompetent. These are nothing more than rumors and heresy however, and nothing has been confirmed by any Faculty member that this is the case. Even still, it is strange how often the Librarian and the Principal are seen together in his office. This has also led to rumors that the two are closeted gay lovers, also unconfirmed.

### Plot

After guiding the main party into getting strong enough to take down the lesser cultist group consisting of [[Pax]], [[Mrs. Lee]], and [[Oliver]], the Librarian reveals himself to be the mastermind and head of the #Cultist organization, or at least the section in Madison County. He then completed the ritual summoning the Hydra before disappearing.
