#MCHS 

### Basic Info

- Full Name: Daniel C. P'Fortis
	- His middle name is just the letter "C"
- Father of [[Oliver]]
- Principal of [[Madison County High School]]

### Personality

A sniveling fool is how most of the school would refer to him, Principal P'Fortis is by all accounts a joke of a Principal. Never speaking at faculty meetings or school events, rarely found in his office or even at school,  

### Relationships

##### [[Oliver]]
Oliver is his son, but it isn't exactly accurate to say that P'Fortis loves him. Oliver has all the traits of his Ex-wife, who was far intelligent and confident then he is. Thus, the ~~good~~ principal is slightly scared that his son will grow up to leave him just like his wife.

##### [[Sabrina]]
Slightly dismissive, Sabrina is dating his son [[Oliver]]. She frequently steals school property, so he often has to bail her out of bad situations. He is getting tired of her and wishes his son would find a less erratic partner.

##### [[Heather]]
Heather is consistently a problem for him, as she is frequently reported for bullying and harassing other students. He is growing increasingly more frustrated with Heather and is considering an expulsion if her behavior continues.

### Plot

The Principal is found in his office hiding under his desk. After talking to the students, he waits for an opportunity and injects himself with a vial that turns him into a griffon. This injection kills him, so even if taken down nonlethally he dies after transforming back into a human.
