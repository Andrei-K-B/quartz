#Cultist #MCHS 

### Basic Info

- Full Name: Paxton Roy Maverick
- [[Jason]]'s best friend
- [[Heather]]'s Ex, started cheating rumors
- Ex Wrestling Team Captain at [[Madison County High School]]

### Personality

Pax is a jock dude bro type guy. He isn't a total asshole, but he's close. Self centered and does things that he thinks would be fun without really thinking about the consequences. Gets jealous easily 

### Relationships

##### [[Jason]]
Best friends, known each other for a very long time. Did martial arts together before getting him into wrestling. 

##### [[Heather]]
Enemies, exes. Heather was a terrible girlfriend while they were dating and obviously didn't care about him, so he kissed another girl to see if she would even react. When she didn't care, he broke things off with her and started rumors about her cheating on him and being an overall bitch. As revenge, Heather got his sports scholarship taken away by showing texts that he bought weed (which he did for her). 

##### [[Sabrina]]
Distaste, while she was dating [[Jason]] he would frequently hit on her out of jealously that his girlfriend actually wanted to romantic with him. Sabrina generally has icky feelings toward him while Jason thinks she is hot.

### Plot

Pax became involved in the Hydra Cult after losing his scholarship and realizing he has nothing left to lose. He basically said "Fuck it" after he lost so much. His sacrificial target is Jason, who he is extremely resentful of after his position as Wrestling Team captain was planned to be handed over to after he is kicked off.
