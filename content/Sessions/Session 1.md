### Session Plan

The party is brought into the library to start serving detention at the end of the school day. After they get acclimated an explosion rings out and an earthquake starts. While they are trying to take cover, the librarian walks out and locks the door with them inside. After a short while, the librarian returns and informs them of the dangers that lurk the school.
